# Dev Mode

Developer-facing map of AdventCompass: stack, feature-to-file table, content sourcing/
licensing notes, and known constraints. See `README.md` for the project overview.

This file is kept up to date as features are added — treat it as the map of what
exists and where, not a changelog of every edit.

## Stack

- Expo Router (file-based routing) — see `app/(tabs)/`
- expo-sqlite for all persistent data (no AsyncStorage) — schema in `database/schema.ts`,
  migrations in `database/migrate.ts` (self-healing: checks actual table shape, not just
  `PRAGMA user_version`, since hot-reload during development can desync the two)
- Theme system: `theme/ThemeProvider.tsx` (light/dark/system, persisted via a `app_kv`
  key-value table)
- Icons: `components/ui/Icon.tsx` wraps Ionicons (`@expo/vector-icons`) behind the same
  component names lucide-react-native used to export, so call sites didn't need to
  change when the icon set was swapped. Two icons (`HeartHandshake`, `NotebookPen`) are
  intentionally still lucide, by request.

## Content sourcing and licensing notes

- **Bible translations**: NHEB, KJV, ASV, MKJV (public domain/permissive), SNA (Shona,
  CC BY-SA 4.0, eBible.org). NKJV was requested but is copyrighted — MKJV was used
  instead by explicit agreement.
- **Hymnals**: sourced from the local Cis Android app's bundled data (Apache 2.0
  compilation) for English/Shona/Ndebele SDA hymnals.
- **Ellen G. White books**: the ellenwhite.info-hosted titles are public domain
  (published before 1929). Several more were parsed directly from PDFs in the user's own
  library — same personal-use basis as the rest of this app's content.
- **S.D.A. Bible Commentary**: parsed from the user's own PDF library (organized by
  Bible book → chapter → verse; volume 7A is a topical appendix, not verse commentary).
- **Cross-references**: openbible.info dataset, CC BY.
- **Sabbath School lessons**: the official app (Adventech, for the GC Sabbath School &
  Personal Ministries department) has no public API. Content is pulled from
  `github.com/Adventech/sabbath-school-lessons` (raw markdown/YAML, no auth needed) —
  **the lesson text itself carries a General Conference copyright notice requiring
  written authorization for reproduction**, separate from that repo's MIT license. This
  app only caches it locally for the app owner's own offline reading; that restriction
  should be kept in mind if this app is ever distributed beyond personal use.
- **Fundamental Beliefs**: parsed from the GC's own 28 Fundamental Beliefs PDF (2015
  edition), in the user's library.
- **Children's Sermons**: sourced from Haverhill SDA Church's public children's-sermon
  archive (`haverhillma.adventistchurch.org`) — a real Adventist congregation's own
  material, not a GC-blanket resource. The site itself says the notes are free to use and
  modify, but there's no formal license grant (single author/congregation, not an org-wide
  policy), so this app treats it the same personal-offline-use-only basis as the other
  externally-sourced content here, not as freely redistributable. Attribution kept in the
  in-app description text.
