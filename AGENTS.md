# Expo HAS CHANGED

Read the exact versioned docs at https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v57.0.0/ before writing any code.

# WORK IN PROGRESS — read this first if resuming a session

(Delete this section once the release APK is verified on-device. It exists purely so a fresh
session in this folder knows where things stand. Sizing is DONE — user chose to stop at 103.6MB
arm64-v8a / 76.2MB armeabi-v7a rather than push further; do not reopen that unless asked.)

**Original ask:** build a release APK, shrink it toward ~100MB, and fix: background/exact-time
notifications, a Friday-5pm-to-Saturday-sunset Sabbath greeting, janky/stuck navigation, a tab
bar that flicks on "more options" taps, and an invisible status bar.

**Done:**
- `android/gradle.properties` + `android/app/build.gradle`: dropped x86/x86_64 (emulator-only)
  and enabled per-ABI APK splits (`armeabi-v7a`, `arm64-v8a`) instead of one universal APK.
- `android/app/build.gradle`: excluded 5 of llama.rn's 7 redundant CPU-variant `.so` files
  (kept baseline + `dotprod`) — its Java loader already falls back gracefully.
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`: added `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`,
  `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`, `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permissions.
- `services/notifications.ts`: `ensureNotificationSetup(db)` now also deep-links to the Android
  exact-alarm settings screen once (`ensureExactAlarmsEnabled`) — signature changed, call sites
  in `app/(tabs)/notes/[id].tsx` and `app/(tabs)/more/notifications.tsx` updated to pass `db`.
- `utils/greeting.ts` + new `hooks/useSabbathGreeting.ts` + new `utils/sunset.ts`: Friday is a
  fixed 00:00–17:00 "Happy Preparation Day" / 17:00–24:00 "Happy Sabbath" cutover; Saturday uses
  a real astronomical sunset (ported SunCalc algorithm) computed from GPS location
  (`expo-location`, newly installed + added to `app.json` plugins) cached in `app_kv`. Wired
  into `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` (was a plain `getGreeting()` call).
- `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` / `app/(tabs)/more/_layout.tsx`: the bottom tab bar's hide-for-More
  logic was round-tripping through a Context + useEffect one render behind the actual
  navigation, causing a visible "flick". Now computed synchronously from `usePathname()` in the
  same render as the nav change; the More-layout effect was deleted entirely.
- `components/bible/VersePopup.tsx` / `TranslationSheet.tsx`: replaced RN `<Modal>` (opens a
  separate Android Window — closing it redraws the host window, which is the other flick
  source) with a plain absolutely-positioned overlay + `BackHandler` for the hardware back
  button. **Note:** other files still use `<Modal>` (`more/notifications.tsx`, `notes/[id].tsx`,
  `more/sabbath-school.tsx`, `bible/[book]/[chapter].tsx`, `HymnNumberJump.tsx`,
  `notes/index.tsx`, `AppAlert.tsx`, `more/health.tsx`) — not touched, only flagged as a
  possible follow-up if flicker is still seen elsewhere.
- `app/_layout.tsx`: added `<StatusBar style={theme.scheme === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark'} />` —
  was never configured before, hence invisible icons.
- **Biggest size win:** `database/*.json` for the 5 full Bible translations and all 49 EGW
  books were `require()`'d directly, so Metro baked their full ~59MB of raw text straight into
  `assets/index.android.bundle` (measured at 77MB, uncompressed-in-APK). Renamed all 54 files
  to `.datjson`, registered that extension in `metro.config.js` (`resolver.assetExts`) so Metro
  treats them as opaque bundled assets instead of inlined JS, and added `database/loadJsonAsset.ts`
  (Asset.fromModule + expo-file-system read + JSON.parse) to load them on demand. This made
  `loadFullBible`/`getEgwBook`/`getEgwChapter` async — call sites updated in
  `app/(tabs)/more/egw/[code].tsx`, `app/(tabs)/more/egw/[code]/[number].tsx` (this one had a
  `setTimeout` hack working around the old synchronous parse — removed, genuinely async now),
  and `database/searchIndex.ts`. **Not converted** (small enough not to matter):
  `crossReferences.json` (2.8MB), `hymnal*.json` (~580KB), `sdaCommentary*.json` (~1.3MB),
  `childrensSermonsData.json` (92KB), `fundamentalBeliefs.json` (28KB), `shonaBookNames.json` (4KB).

**Size history** (arm64-v8a / armeabi-v7a release APKs) — FINAL, confirmed by real builds:
- Original universal APK (4 ABIs): 279MB
- After ABI split + drop x86/x86_64: 194MB / 118MB
- After llama.rn variant trim + Bible/EGW JSON moved out of the JS bundle: **103.6MB / 76.2MB**
- User explicitly chose to stop here rather than push further (would've meant either dropping
  the AI engine's universal fallback variant, or enabling untested R8 minification). Don't
  reopen this without being asked again.

**Not yet done / never confirmed:**
- The rebuilt+resized APK has not been installed and smoke-tested on a real device or emulator.
- Notifications' exact-alarm settings redirect (`Linking.sendIntent`) has not been verified to
  actually open the right screen on a real device.
- The Sabbath greeting's GPS sunset calculation has not been verified against a real location.
- Whether R8 minification is even still needed depends on the rebuild result above.

**Build environment gotcha (cost real time this session):** never run `gradlew`/`gradlew.bat`
from Git Bash — it sets `MSYSTEM=MINGW64`, which breaks CMake's Android NDK toolchain detection
("CMAKE_RC_COMPILER not set"). Always build via the PowerShell tool instead. Also: PowerShell's
default log redirection (`*>`) writes UTF-16LE — pipe through `iconv -f UTF-16LE -t UTF-8` before
grepping a redirected log file from Bash.
